     <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p> Hi everyone, my name is Johnathan.  I am currently employed full time for a Fortune 500 company.  I have enrolled into the Thinkful program to expand my skillset.
         It has been challenging and rewarding at times.  I do enjoy all of the individuals I continue to meet along the way and I do appreciate my mentor Val.  Finally, one last thing to note, I like, 
         <ul>
             <li>Fantasy Football</li>
             <li>Fantasy Basketball</li>
             <li>Fantasy Baseball</li>
         </ul>
 
         then sometimes hockey.  But if I had to rank my favorite non-fantasy sports, then it would be, 
         <ol>
             <li> Track and Field</li>
             <li> Basketball</li>
             <li> Football</li>
         </ol>
        </p>
